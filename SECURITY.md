## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

#### Input Validation
```javascript
// Validate email format
function isValidEmail(email) {
  const emailRegex = /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/;
  return typeof email === 'string' && emailRegex.test(email);
}

// Validate password strength
function isValidPassword(password) {
  return typeof password === 'string' &&
    password.length >= 8 &&
    /(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\d)/.test(password);
}

// Sanitize user input
function sanitizeInput(input) {
  return input.replace(/[\x00-\x1F\x7F]/g, '').trim();
}
```

#### Environment Variables
```javascript
// Use environment variables for sensitive data
const config = {
  apiKey: env.API_KEY,
  databaseUrl: env.DATABASE_URL,
  jwtSecret: env.JWT_SECRET
};

// Never hardcode secrets
// ‚ùå const apiKey = 'sk-1234567890abcdef';
// ‚úÖ const apiKey = env.API_KEY;
```

#### Error Handling
```javascript
// Don't expose sensitive information in errors
try {
  await authenticateUser(credentials);
} catch (error) {
  // ‚ùå return { error: error.message };
  // ‚úÖ return { error: 'Authentication failed' };
}
```

#### Rate Limiting
```javascript
// Implement rate limiting for signup attempts
const rateLimiter = {
  maxAttempts: 5,
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  
  async checkLimit(identifier) {
    // Implementation here
  }
};
```

### For Deployment

#### Environment Configuration

- **Never commit secrets** to version control
- **Use Wrangler secrets** for sensitive data
- **Implement proper CORS** for production domains
- **Use HTTPS only** in production
- **Validate all environment variables** at startup

#### Production Security Headers

```javascript
const securityHeaders = {
  'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  'X-Content-Type-Options': 'nosniff',
  'X-Frame-Options': 'DENY',
  'X-XSS-Protection': '1; mode=block',
  'Referrer-Policy': 'strict-origin-when-cross-origin',
  'Content-Security-Policy': "default-src 'none'",
  'Strict-Transport-Security': 'max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains'
};
```

## Common Security Vulnerabilities

### 1. Injection Attacks

**Risk**: SQL injection, NoSQL injection, command injection

**Prevention**:
- Use parameterized queries
- Validate and sanitize all inputs
- Use allow-lists for acceptable values

### 2. Broken Authentication

**Risk**: Weak passwords, session hijacking, credential stuffing

**Prevention**:
- Enforce strong password policies
- Implement account lockout mechanisms
- Use secure session management
- Require CAPTCHA for repeated attempts

### 3. Sensitive Data Exposure

**Risk**: Unencrypted data, weak encryption, exposed keys

**Prevention**:
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
- Use strong encryption algorithms
- Properly manage encryption keys
- Never log sensitive information

### 4. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Risk**: Malicious script injection, session hijacking

**Prevention**:
- Validate and sanitize all inputs
- Use content security policies
- Encode outputs properly
- Use secure frameworks

### 5. Insecure Direct Object References

**Risk**: Unauthorized access to resources

**Prevention**:
- Implement proper authorization checks
- Use random IDs instead of sequential ones
- Validate user permissions for each request
